Server Side Validation: done in backend which can't be reached so basically JOI is used to do so.
JOI: it is a package actually the most powerfull one. It is a schema descriptive language. And hence validates the data
 first step: define the schema
 second step: wherever it is used, it has to be validated

 Session: it is a server-side storage. and SSS are more sequre. So, the sensitive information which may cause
          harm if left un protected, they are stored in Session. 

Session also stores key-valu pairs like cookies

So, now every time a response is sent, in form of cookies, it is sent with a unique session id.
